1. First i try to read the csv file using FileStream and put it in array
2. Getting the file exclude the first line, then make it in 2D array for courses id and the name, courses and the prerequisite
3. After getting the 2D array i looping to get the course id and prerequisites it need example course 8 needed 6,7,10,12 
   course before
4. Then i looping again to get the course id and the prerequisite it need and check if the prerequisite is already taken or not
5. If the prerequisite is already taken then i add the course id to the taken course array
6. After looping all the course i will get the taken course array and print it out 
7. Your prerequisites.csv i think it's imposible to complete, because the 4,9 the course 4 need to complete 1,3,9. Then 
   course 9 need course 5, course 5 need course 4 it gonna loop forever
8. If you delete prerequisites 4,9 my code will work properly because it's possible, your prerequisites is imposible to complete
